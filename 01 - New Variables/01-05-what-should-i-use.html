		// const vs let
		// 
		// Opinion #1:
		// https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/es6-const
		// use const by default
		// only use let if rebinding is needed
		// (var shouldn't be used in ES6)
		// 
		// Opinion #2:
		// https://davidwalsh.name/for-and-against-let
		// Use var for top-level variables that are shared across many (especially) larger scopes.
		// Use let for localized variables in smaller scopes.
		// Refactor let to const only after some code has been written and you're reasonably sure
		// that you've got a case where there shouldn't be variable reassignment.
